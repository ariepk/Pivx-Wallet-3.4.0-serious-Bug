# Pivx-Wallet-3.4.0-serious-Bug
Hi There
On Nov-2019 I downloaded the 3.4.0. wallet on a VPS, running under windows server 2012. I sent a small amount of PIV's and started experimenting with the wallet, in order to  manage staking. After a few days of playing around, I decided to move my PIV's to the wallet and proceed with the staking.
I pressed the "receive" button on the wallet, and started by sending 5000 PIV's from my nano ledger to the address that appeared on the wallet (DEE3aEoFdgtyBk8cs88UjDxbeauXhxtoh6). The 5000 piv's reached the DEE3aEoFdgtyBk8cs88UjDxbeauXhxtoh6 address, but DID NOT REACH my wallet, and I do not have access to them. When checking the address on block explorer, I can see that the piv's reached the address on 18-Nov-2011, and are still there.
After the initial failed transfer of 5000 piv, I sent a few small transfers to the wallet, to the newly generated "receive" addresses, and they all arrived. Only the first initial "receive" address (after a long period experimentation without  incoming transfers) failed.
My first reaction was to believe that somehow i was hacked, and the initial address was "planted" on my wallet. I contacted the support team of my VPS, but they of course denied any connection to  what happened.
I registered to a different VPS provider, downloaded the wallet, and pasted the wallet.dat file from my previous VPS (again working under windows 2012 network). After a few days of playing around, on 08-DEC-2019, I pressed again the "receive" button on my recreated wallet, and sent 1 piv to the generated address (DQHS6Ay3CEvGCWwvKpziRHD6P3RwgNDE48). Again - the 1 piv reached that address, and again it DID NOT reach my wallet and is out of my control. This time - i took a screen snap that shows my wallet with the above "receive" address (see attached)

This brings me to the conclusion that i was not dealing with a hack, but with a very serious bug in the wallet.
My hope is that this bug will be sorted out and fixed, and perhaps I will be able to get my 5000 piv back
